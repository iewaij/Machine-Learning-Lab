A place to play with machine learning and deep learning.

## Seg_text
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

## N-gram
Generate sentences based on the N-gram model. Details behind N-gram model are expained in [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/2017/03/14/N-gram/) in Chinese.

## Naive-bayes
Determine whether the input Chinese sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

## Gradient-descent
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

## Mini-batch-gradient-descent
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

## Neural-network-classification
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) based on artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer. The ANN framework is TensorFlow.
