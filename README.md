# Code Examples
My code example focusing on machine learning and data science.

[Seg_text](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Seg-text)  
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

[N-gram](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/N-gram/article_n-gram.ipynb)  
Generate sentences based on the N-gram model. Details behind N-gram model are expained in [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/2017/03/14/N-gram/) in Chinese.

[Naive-bayes](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Naive-bayes/Naive_Emo_Bayes.ipynb)  
Determine whether input sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

[Gradient descent](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Gradient-descent/Gradient_Descent.ipynb)  
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

[Mini-batch gradient descent](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Mini-batch-gradient-descent/mini_batch_gradient_descent.ipynb)  
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

[Neural-network classification](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Neural-network-classification)  
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) based on artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer. The ANN framework is TensorFlow.
