# Code Examples
My code example focusing on Python programming and data science.

## Python Basics
[**Greatest Common Divisor**](/gcdRecur.py)
Find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` recursively.

[**Prime Number**](/genPrimes.py)
Generate a list of prime numbers recursively.

[**Hanoi Tower**](/hanoiTowerSolver.py)
Solve Hanoi tower problem recursively.

[**Seg_text**](/Seg-text)
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

## Data Science
[**Relational Database**](/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/relational_data.ipynb)
Read, save and filter relational data using _sqlite3_. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Time Series Data**](/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/time_series.ipynb)
Using _pandas_ and _matplotlib_ to explore time series data form Pittsburgh buses. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Linear Regression**](/Linear%20Regression/linear_regression.ipynb)
Using analytical method of least square to predict the ETA of buses in Pittsburgh. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**SVM Tweets Classification**](/Tweets%20Classification/text_classification.ipynb)
Predict the political background (GOP or Democratic) from a tweet using SVM from _scikit-learn_. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**N-gram**](/N-gram/article_n-gram.ipynb)
Generate sentences using N-gram model. The corpus is [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/) in Chinese.

[**Naive-bayes**](/Naive-bayes/Naive_Emo_Bayes.ipynb)
Determine whether input sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

[**Gradient Descent**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Gradient-descent/Gradient_Descent.ipynb)
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

[**Mini-batch gradient descent**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Mini-batch-gradient-descent/mini_batch_gradient_descent.ipynb)
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

[**Neural-network classification**](/Neural-network-classification)
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) using _TensorFlow_.
