# Code Examples
My code example focusing on Python programming and data science.

## Python Basics
[**Greatest Common Divisor**](/gcdRecur.py)  
Find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` recursively.

[**Prime Number**](/genPrimes.py)  
Generate a list of prime numbers recursively.

[**Hanoi Tower**](/hanoiTowerSolver.py)  
Solve Hanoi tower problem recursively.

[**Separate Text**](/Seg-text/seg_stat.py)  
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

## Other Languages
[**SML**](/sml.sml)  
Standard ML is a general-purpose, modular, functional programming language with compile-time type checking and type inference. In the code I made several functions to takle date calculation.

[**Julia**](https://github.com/iewaij/DiffEqParamEstim.jl/blob/dev/src/build_loss_objective.jl)  
Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. In this example, I build a function to calculate multi-loss of parameter estimation.

## Data Science
[**Relational Database**](/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/relational_data.ipynb)  
Read, save and filter relational data using _sqlite3_. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Time Series Data**](/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/time_series.ipynb)  
Using _pandas_ and _matplotlib_ to explore time series data form Pittsburgh buses. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Linear Regression**](/Linear%20Regression/linear_regression.ipynb)  
Using analytical method of least square to predict the ETA of buses in Pittsburgh. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Tweets Classification**](/Tweets%20Classification/text_classification.ipynb)  
Predict the political background (GOP or Democratic) from a tweet using SVM from _scikit-learn_. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Data Collection through Web API and EDA**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-examples/blob/master/Data%20Collection%20through%20Web%20API/hw2.ipynb) Â 
Collect data through Twitter API and detect whether the top two US president candidates' tweets were written by their aides through visualization. It is based on homework from [DS100](http://www.ds100.org/sp17/materials)

[**N-gram**](/N-gram/article_n-gram.ipynb)  
Generate sentences using N-gram model. The corpus is [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/) in Chinese.

[**Naive-bayes**](/Naive-bayes/Naive_Emo_Bayes.ipynb)  
Determine whether input sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

[**Gradient Descent**](/Gradient%20Descent//Gradient_Descent.ipynb)  
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

[**Mini-batch gradient descent**](/Mini-batch%20Gradient%20Descent/mini_batch_gradient_descent.ipynb)  
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

[**Neural-network classification**](/Neural-network%20Classification/sigmoid_1h_nn.ipynb)  
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) using _TensorFlow_.
