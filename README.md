# Code Examples
My code example focusing on machine learning and data science.

[**Seg_text**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Seg-text)  
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

[**Relational Database**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-examples/blob/master/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/relational_data.ipynb)  
Read, save and filter relational data using **sqlite3**. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Time Series Data**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-examples/blob/master/Relational%20Database%20and%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/time_series.ipynb)  
Using **pandas** and **matplotlib** to explore time series data form Pittsburgh buses. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**Linear Regression**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-examples/blob/master/Linear%20Regression/linear_regression.ipynb)  
Using analytical method of least square to predict the ETA of buses in Pittsburgh. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**SVM Tweets Classification****](https://github.com/iewaij/code-examples/blob/master/Tweets%20Classification/text_classification.ipynb)  
Predict the political background (GOP or Democratic) from a tweet using SVM from **scikit-learn**. It is based on homework from [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/).

[**N-gram**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/N-gram/article_n-gram.ipynb)  
Generate sentences based on the N-gram model. Details behind N-gram model are expained in [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/2017/03/14/N-gram/) in Chinese.

[**Naive-bayes**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Naive-bayes/Naive_Emo_Bayes.ipynb)  
Determine whether input sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

[**Gradient Descent**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Gradient-descent/Gradient_Descent.ipynb)  
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

[**Mini-batch gradient descent**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/blob/master/Mini-batch-gradient-descent/mini_batch_gradient_descent.ipynb)  
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

[**Neural-network classification**](https://github.com/iewaij/code-example/tree/master/Neural-network-classification)  
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) using **TensorFlow**.
