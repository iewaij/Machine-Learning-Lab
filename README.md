# Machine Learning Lab
A place to play with machine learning and deep learning.

## Seg_text
Separate text into list and calculate word frequency.

## [N-gram](https://github.com/iewaij/Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/master/N-gram/article_n-gram.ipynb)
Generate sentences based on the N-gram model. Details behind N-gram model are expained in [my blog](http://lijiawei.cc/2017/03/14/N-gram/) in Chinese.

## [Naive-bayes](https://github.com/iewaij/Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/master/Naive-bayes/Naive_Emo_Bayes.ipynb)
Determine whether input sentence is positive or negative based on naive bayes algorithm.

## [Gradient-descent](https://github.com/iewaij/Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/master/Gradient-descent/Gradient_Descent.ipynb)
Linear regression based on gradient descent algorithm.

## [Mini-batch-gradient-descent](https://github.com/iewaij/Machine-Learning-Lab/tree/master/Mini-batch-gradient-descent)
Calculate the same linear regression as gradient descent but using smaller sample to train the model.

## [Neural-network-classification](https://github.com/iewaij/Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/master/Neural-network-classification/sigmoid_1h_nn.ipynb)
Classify whether the data is 1 or 0 (shown in the decision boundary graph) based on artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer. The ANN framework is TensorFlow.
